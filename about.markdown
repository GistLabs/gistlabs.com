# About Me

Hi! I'm John, and this is my personal website.

I work on various projects and enjoy sharing my thoughts through writing. This site is built with Jekyll, a static site generator that allows me to write everything in Markdown.

## Interests
- Web development
- Open source software
- Learning new technologies

Feel free to check out my [blog](/blog/) for updates and thoughts.
